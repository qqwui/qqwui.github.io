<h2>Who was he?</h2>
<p>Tim Berners-Lee was born on 8 June 1955 in London, England. His parents were computer scientists. He learned electronics as a child by tinkering with model railways. He studied physics in The Queen's College, Oxford and got a first-class bachelor of arts degree there. Berners worked as an independent contractor for CERN.</p>

<h2>What did he make?</h2>
<p>While working for CERN in 1980, he proposed a project based on hypertext to share information between researchers. He built ENQUIRE as a proof of concept. In 1989, Berners-Lee got the opportunity to integrate hypertext with the internet. In his words:</p>
<blockquote cite="https://www.achievement.org/achiever/sir-timothy-berners-lee/#interview">
I just had to take the hypertext idea and connect it to the Transmission Control Protocol and domain name system ideas and—ta-da!—the World Wide Web ... Creating the web was really an act of desperation, because the situation without it was very difficult when I was working at CERN later. Most of the technology involved in the web, like the hypertext, like the internet, multifont text objects, had all been designed already. I just had to put them together. It was a step of generalising, going to a higher level of abstraction, thinking about all the documentation systems out there as being possibly part of a larger imaginary documentation system.
</blockquote>
<p>Berners-Lee wrote the proposal in 1989 and distributed it in 1990. He used ideas from the ENQUIRE prototype and created the World Wide Web. He made the first web server, the first web browser and the first web editor all written for the NeXT Workstation.</p>
