## About the Archive
I've made a lot of websites, mainly in my middle school years. ~~all of which are pretty bad~~ I figured I've made enough of them that I could create one big website to host them for all prosperity. Also, unlike all the other ones, this one's made using Jekyll, so I don't have to worry so much about looks and stuff.
I haven't got 'round to it yet, but each of the websites will have a write-up associated with them so you can see the history behind each one.

The website is hosted on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com) and the code is available on the [Github Repo](https://github.com/qqwui/qqwui.github.io).

## About me
Well, I'm just a person with an inability to focus who likes messing with computers. I guess the two go together pretty well. My personal blog is over at [qqwui.blahaj.land](https://qqwui.blahaj.land).

I've put this on every other website here, so might as well continue the tradition:<br>
